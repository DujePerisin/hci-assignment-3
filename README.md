## Project description
This project will be based on my previous assignment where I was required to designed a sitemap and information flow of the website.
Brief description of the targeted website:

For this assignment, I envisioned a professional research blog website where the owner, an expert in their field, shares research findings, ideas and insights. The website will provide an easy way for visitors to reach out, featuring a contact page with a fill-out form for a more practical communication. Additionally, it will showcase a detailed summary of the owner’s professional travel appearances, including conferences attended as both a speaker and participant, to establish credibility and demonstrate the owner’s active role in the field. Finally, the website will feature an “About Me” page which will detailly showcase the owner’s career, complete with a list of academic achievements. This design could serve as a model for others at a similar stage in their respective careers.
